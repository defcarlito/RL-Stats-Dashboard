todo:
  1:
    - update firebase db to store "date_index/"
    - ex:
      - date_index/
        {YYYY-MM-DD}: {matchCount: x, lastUpdated: {StartEpoch from last game}
        ...
      - maybe also store daily global stats for daily graphs like:
        - total solo goals
        - total team goals
        - total goals conceded
        - etc

  2:
    - update firebase db to store "opponent_history/"
    - will use to track performance against repeated opponents

  3:
    - fix opponent display to show all opponents for 2s games
